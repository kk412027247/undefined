还有玛蕾·贾维斯
And there's Marley Jarvis

她自己开了一家日光浴沙龙

而且实际上 我们定位到这病毒

病毒是怎样跨物种传播的？
How can a virus jump species like that?

我们就是没能弄明白

如果他们让我们返校
If they're letting us go back to school

那很快一切也都会恢复了
Then soon we can get back to everything

我想 难道那不意味着事情终于
I mean, doesn't this mean things are finally

要回归正常了嘛？爸？
Going back to normal? Dad?

我得走了！
I gotta go!

那就他妈的把未来世界卖了！
Then sell fucking Epcot Center!

我们在武汉上了那只蝙蝠的事吗？
When we fucked that bat in Wuhan?

我上过的蝙蝠多了！
I've fucked a lot of bats!

好吧 但我只上过一只！
Well, I've only fucked one!

我记得 就在那之后 我感觉很不舒服
I remember...right after, I got really sick

那都是十月份的事情了
And this was all back in October

上帝啊 你个混蛋！这一切都是因为你！
Jesus Christ, you fucker! You started all this!

是你让我去上那只蝙蝠的！
You told me to fuck the bat!

你回家之后没在家自我隔离吗？
You didn't quarantine yourself after you got home?

我上那只蝙蝠的时候也没新冠这回事啊！
Nobody knew anything about COVID when I fucked the bat!

我以为我从中国回来的时候只是得了流感了！
I thought I just came back from China with the flu!

听着 我们不能让科学家们找到那只蝙蝠
Look. We can't let scientists find that bat

我老婆是个疯婆子
My wife is crazy

要是她发现疫情是因我而起
If she finds out I started the pandemic

她可就要婊死我了
She's gonna be a total bitch about it

伙计 你不会相信的
Dude, you are not gonna believe this

你在这干嘛？
What are you doing here?

你爸爸在家吗 凯尔？我们得和律师谈谈
Is your dad home, Kyle? We need to talk to a lawyer

布罗夫洛夫斯基先生？

如果你想聊聊 我们可以去外面聊！
If you wanna talk, we can go outside!

他们要让我们返校了
They're gonna try and make us go back to school

老兄 你没准就在传播病菌！
Dude, you could be spreading germs!

来阻止学校强迫我们返校
To stop the schools from forcing us back

现在 不管你那想要返校的想法
Now, whatever your messed-up beliefs are

有多么莫名其妙
About wanting to go to school...

你真的想要接下来一整年都用Zoom上网课吗？
You really wanna spend the next year on Zoom?

你不一定非得Zoom在线啊
You don't have to be on Zoom

有无数的方法可以做手脚呢！
There's a million ways around it!

记住我的话 凯尔 首先 他们会强迫我们返校
Mark my words, Kyle. First, they'll force us back to school

然后他们便不再让我们保持社交距离了
Then they'll take social distancing away from us completely

然后我就得离开自己的房间出来和你鬼混了！
And I'll be out of my room having to hang out with you!

你现在就没在自己的房间和我一起啊
You're out of your room hanging out with me now

噢 我的天啊 他们全都得兜着走

回到教室里上课

大家能听到我说话么？
Can everyone hear me m'kay?

好么 我们已经做出
M'kay, well, parents, we've made

一些非常棒的调整和人事安排了 好么
Some amazing adjustments and hirings, m'kay

我们相信孩子们星期一就能回来上课了 好么？
We believe we can welcome students back on Monday. M'kay?

你们准备怎么处理呢？
How are you going to do this?

对啊 我儿子怎么能和克雷格·塔克坐同个教室里？
Yeah, what happens when my son is sitting in a room with Craig Tucker

他爸出门了连口罩都不戴
Whose father doesn't even wear a mask outside?

噢 你他妈又来了！别拿口罩的事情说我了 斯多奇！
Oh, here we fucking go again! Stop mask shaming, Stotch!

如果你把口罩戴在下巴下面
Well, it's really not a mask if you wear it

那真不是个口罩 那就是个下巴尿布
Down around your chin. That's a chin diaper

没有实质性证据证明口罩
There's no real proof that a mask

到底他妈的有没有用！
Even fucking does anything!

这话说的太像个乡巴佬了！
Spoken like a true redneck!

噢 我可去你妈的吧！
Oh, fuck you!

好了 好了 大家安静一下！
M'kay, m'kay, everyone! Alright!

这不公平！
That's not fair!

够了！
M'kay!

我把所有人都禁言了！好么？
I just muted everybody! M'kay?

如果大家不能好好谈
Now, if we don't get along

我就坐在这儿把你们都给禁言了
I'll just sit here with you all on mute

-I was at Ross! -

好么 嘣！你们都被禁言了！
M'kay! Boom! You're all muted!

好么？我可以和你们耗一整天！
M'kay? I can do this all day!

现在学校已经做出了改进
Now, we've made changes at the school

我们觉得已经做好让孩子们回来上课的准备了
And we feel prepared to welcome your students back

多诺万先生
Mr. Donovan

我不关心你们做了什么改进
I don't care what changes you've made

但我儿子克莱德不会去学校！
My son Clyde is not going to class!

这是你自己的权力 禁言了！
And that is your prerogative. Mute!

你说 马什太太
M'kay. Mrs. Marsh

我觉得老师们都没回学校才是问题所在
I thought that the issue was the teachers not coming back

说得没错
That is correct

老师们认为回学校还不安全
Our teaching staff does not feel safe to return

但是…我们已经聘请了新老师 好么
But....we have hired all new teachers. M'kay

他们因为最近的事件丢了工作
These are people who have recently lost their jobs

而且非常渴望得到新工作
Due to recent events and are desperate for work

所以他们什么活都肯干
M'kay. So they'll do just about anything

什么新老师？
What new teachers?

好 伙计们！
Alright, men!

※指乔治·弗洛伊德事件后 部分地方政府停止资助警方

大伙都知道 由于最近的事情完全失控
As you all know, due to recent events totally beyond our control

我们大部分资金都没了
We have lost most of our funding

但这次的新工作肯定会很棒
But this new venture will be great

据我所知 我们都会出任小学老师
And I know we will all thrive as elementary schoolteachers

这可能是我们最后的工作机会了
This might be our last chance at a job

所以我不希望出现意外伤亡
So I don't want any unnecessary deaths

噢！噢！拒绝意外伤亡！
Ahp! Ahp! No unnecessary deaths!

让我们向小镇展示 我们是多棒的领导者
And let's show this town just what great leaders we can be

这会很棒的
This is gonna be great

传染到人身上来了
To jump from it to humans

什么东西引发了新冠病毒重要吗？
Does it matter what started coronavirus?

谁关心这个啊？
Who cares what started coronavirus?

你们这是在歧视！
You guys are being racist!

我们不需要看这种东西！遥控器在哪儿？
We don't need to watch this! Where's the remote?

这是…这是歧视性的节目
This is... This is racist television

我他妈不想看这个！
And we're not gonna watch it!

-I want to hear this, Randy! -No!

知道吗？你们实在是太可怕了
No. You know what? You guys are horrible!

快…快给我停下来！
Just... Just stop it right now!

你们追踪病毒去了武汉
You traced the virus to Wuhan

但发现源头并不是蝙蝠 是这样吗？
But what you found was not a bat. Is that correct?

没错 病毒并不是从蝙蝠开始传播的
No, no, the virus did not come from a bat

你们…什么？他说什么了？
You guys...What? What'd he say?

我们成功突破了病毒的研究
We were able to break down the virus enough

发现和蝙蝠没有半点关系
To see there was actually no bat involved

和蝙蝠没关系 和蝙蝠没关系！
No bat involved. No bat involved!

*噢耶 噢耶*
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah

*不是蝙蝠 不是蝙蝠！*
It wasn't a bat, it wasn't a bat

*不是蝙蝠 看到了吧！*
It wasn't a bat, in your face!

*看到了吧 不是蝙蝠！*
In your face, it wasn't a bat

当我们追踪病毒时 我们发现它确实是
When we tracked the virus, we found it did originate

发源于武汉 但实际是来自于一种鳞甲目生物
In Wuhan, but from a species called pholidota

那这种鳞甲目生物到底是什么？
And what exactly is pholidota?

是一只穿山甲 而它现在就在这儿
It's a pangolin. And here it is right over here

-妈 什么是穿山甲？ -我也不知道
-What's a pangolin, Mom? -I'm not even sure

你知道穿山甲是什么吗 兰迪？

Do you know what a pangolin is, Dad?

哈哈！哈哈！
Ha ha! Ha ha!

我还是不敢相信你操了那只蝙蝠 老兄
Dude, I still can't believe you fucked that bat

哈哈！
Ha ha!

-好了 好了 嘘！ -哈哈！
-Okay, okay. Shh! -Ha ha!

你真的让她嗨上天了！噢 我的天！
You really let her have it! Oh, boy!

够了！我现在不想回想那个 米奇
Okay! I don't wanna think about that right now, Mickey

我只是被震撼到了 就这样
I'm just impressed, that's all

我是说 如果你连蝙蝠都能搞定 那…
I mean, if you can handle a bat, then...

那什么？
Then what?

你操过穿山甲吗？
You ever have sex with a pangolin?

穿山甲是他妈个什么东西？
What the fuck is a pangolin?

哈哈！哇哦！吼吼！
Ha ha! Ha whoa! Ho ho!

哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈！
Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha!

我操！
Shit!

好了 孩子们 欢迎回到课堂
Alright, children, welcome back to class

我是你们的新老师 哈里斯警探
I'm your new teacher, Detective Harris

这是你们的助教
And this is our homeroom teacher's assistant

约翰逊警官
Officer Johnston

我们今天先来学些数学
Let's start the day off with some math

有人会数学吗？
Does anyone understand math?

谁愿意带头教同学们数学？
Who would like to lead the class with some math?

疫情！有疫情！你们不能逼我去上学！
Pandemic! There's a pandemic! You can't make me go to school!

你们不能…啊！啊！不 不 不！
You can't...Arghh! Aaaghh! No, no, no!

哦 不 不！你们不能逼我！
Oh, no, no! You can't make me!

我不知道我能不能做到 米奇
I don't know if I can do this, Mitch

我他妈讨厌小孩 我当不了老师
I fucking hate kids. I can't be a teacher

我们只能干这个了 长官 我来试试吧
It's all we got, sir. Let me try

孩子们！好了！快点！安静下来！
Kids! Alright! Come on! Let's settle down!

现在我们来画一些手指画吧 听到了吗？
Now we're gonna do some fingerpaints. You got that?

你们用手指画一些…
You're gonna fingerpaint...

“你所选的有袋动物或是夏天做过的趣事”
"a marsupial of your choice or a fun thing you did over the summer."

你们不能让我们待在这儿！
You can't make us stay here!

这侵犯了我们的自由！你们谁赞同我说的？
This is a violation of our freedom! Who's with me, guys?

好了 听着！我们现在要开始画手指画了！
Now, listen! We're gonna start fingerpaintin' right now!

哦 我的天呐！我都忘了跟大家在一起感觉如此糟糕！
Oh, my God! I forgot how much it sucks to be around everybody!

我觉得我要发病了！凯尔我病你一脸！
I think I'm gonna be sick! All over Kyle!

去死吧！
Fuck you!

够了！
That's enough!

搞定！
Got him!

这就是那个动物了
And here it is

这是我们在中国抓到的穿山甲
This is the pangolin we tracked down in China

我们也许能通过它制出疫苗
The animal that could lead us to a vaccine

新冠的谜团可能会通过我们对这个生物的研究
The mysteries of COVID can be unlocked

而就此解开
By our studies of this creature

我想让你们都和它保持距离
I'll just ask you all to keep a good distance away

显然我们不能让这只穿山甲出任何事
Obviously we can't let anything happen to this pangolin

你们看 这只穿山甲的DNA已经变异了
You see, this pangolin's DNA has mutated

我们认为这就是疫情的源头
Which is what we believe started it all

这只穿山甲是如何变异的？
The pangolin has mutated how?

我们不能完全确定
We're not completely sure

但我们现在可以确信 有东西通过一些手段…
But we believe now that something somehow...

把自己的DNA注入了这只穿山甲体内
Got its DNA up into the pangolin

这具体是怎么发生的呢？
How exactly could that happen?

嗯 这 就像是另一个生物
Well, i-it's almost like another creature

不知怎么的就把自己的DNA注入了穿山甲体内
Somehow inserted its DNA up into the pangolin

也许是一些其他的物种
Perhaps some other species

不知怎么就和穿山甲交媾了？
Somehow mated with the pangolin?

哦 得了吧！什么动物
Oh, come on! What kind of animal

会和穿山甲做爱啊？
Would have sex with a pangolin?

对啊！看看那玩意多丑！
Yeah! Look how ugly that thing is!

对啊 对啊！
- -Yeah. Yeah!

好了 好了
Okay. Okay

再说一遍 重要的是 我们需要解码
Again, what really matters is that we decode

注入穿山甲体内的外源DNA
The foreign DNA inside the pangolin

这可能是疫苗的关键 甚至可能是解药
That would be the key to a vaccine, perhaps even a cure

我们需要知道什么东西强暴了这只穿山甲
We have to know what raped the pangolin

哦 所以现在又说“强暴”了
Oh. So now it was "rape."

不好意思 先生 你是谁？
Excuse me, sir. Who are you?

这次观展是为传染病学专业的科学家准备的
This tour is for scientists that specialize in pandemics

你…你是疫情方面的专家吗？
Are you.... a pandemic specialist?

对啊 我是疫情专家 我现在就在做疫情特售呢
Yeah, I'm a pandemic specialist. I'm making one right now

哦…好吧 不管怎样 现在大家都跟我去微生物实验室吧
O-kay. Anyway, if you all follow me now to the micro labs

我给你们展示一下
I can show you the containment system

疫苗进入试验期时的围护机制
For once a vaccine is able to be tried

好么 好么 家长们？
M'kay. M'kay, parents?

大家都能听到我么？
Can everyone hear me m'kay?

大家听着
Everyone listen up.

我们不想引发公众恐慌 好么
We don't want anyone to panic, m'kay

但我们校内出现了一例新冠病例
But there has been a COVID exposure here at the school

好么 有一位四年级生
M'kay. One of our fourth graders

几小时前被送往医院了 好么？
Was taken to the hospital a couple hours ago, m'kay?

但是我们…我们觉得托肯会好起来的
But we... we think Token's gonna be okay

现在 根据县法规 每个在学校里的人
Now, due to county protocol, everyone that was in the school

都要隔离两周
Now has to quarantine for two weeks

所以我们要把你们的孩子们留在这儿
So we will be keeping your kids here

老师们会和他们待在一起的
And the teachers will be staying with them

好了 学生们 安静
Alright, students, shut up

我知道你们不想遭遇这种情况
I know this situation is not ideal

但我们得一起隔离两周
But we all have to quarantine together for two weeks

这他妈太扯淡了！
This is bullshit!

你不想传染给你的家人 对吧？
You don't want to infect your families, do you?

你们都和这儿的一个
You were all exposed to a student here

由于新冠被送进医院的学生接触过
Who was taken to the hospital due to COVID

什么事？
Yes?

呃 我们当时在现场 托肯其实是
Uh, we were there, and Token was actually

因为你们枪击了才被送进医院的
Taken to the hospital because you guys shot him

是的 还是因为新冠
Yes, due to COVID

如果不是因为新冠 之前所有的老师
If it weren't for COVID, all the previous teachers

都还会在这里
Would have still been here

我们就不会出现在你们的课堂上
We wouldn't have been in the class

这样就没人会被枪击了
And nobody would have gotten shot

因此这个年轻人是因为新冠才在医院的
Therefore the young man is in the hospital due to COVID

这就叫“新冠相关”
It was COVID-related

这简直狗屁不通！
That doesn't make any sense!

科学家们要求南方公园的所有居民
And scientists are asking all South Park County residents

留心一下这种生物
To keep an eye out for the creature

再说一遍 那只穿山甲昨天从研究机构中逃出
Once again, the pangolin escaped from the facility yesterday

许多人忧心忡忡
And many people are fearing the worst

科学家们称尽管
Scientists say that even though

他们已经有了穿山甲的样本
They have samples from the pangolin

但如今仍旧未获得研制疫苗所需的东西
They now don't have what they need for a vaccine

是的 我们现在需要的是
Yes, you see, what we needed was the foreign DNA

穿山甲体内的外源DNA
That was up inside the pangolin

那个DNA将是我们研制出治愈方法的关键
It's whatever that DNA was that was our key to a cure

你好？有人在家吗？
Hello? Anyone home?

你有个快递 请签收
Got a delivery here. Needs a signature

哦 好的
Oh, okay

哦 嘿-嘿 如果你要靠近的话
Oh, h-hey. If you're gonna come any closer

你可以戴一个 呃 下巴尿布吗？
Would you mind wearing a, you know, chin diaper?

哦 不好意思
Oh. Sorry

请拿好 在这签名
Here you go. Just sign right there

祝你生活愉快
Have a nice day

哦 还有 嘿 我真的很喜欢疫情特售
Oh, and, hey. I'm really loving the Pandemic Special

是吗 谢谢
Yeah, thanks

你为什么给我寄那东西？
Why did you send that to me?

哈哈！因为你是死人一个了 马什！
Ha ha! Because you're a dead man, Marsh!

你的DNA就是研制疫苗所需的东西！哈哈！
It's your DNA that they need for a vaccine! Ha ha!

是的 我知道 但我不能去自首！
Yeah, I know, but I can't just turn myself in!

马什 这无关人情冷暖 不过利来利往
This isn't personal, Marsh. It's business

我要把你杀了 然后偷偷地把你的DNA
I'm having you killed, then secretly we'll send your DNA

送到科学家那里去研制疫苗 哈哈
To the scientists for the vaccine. Ha ha

这都是你的错 米老鼠！
This is all your fault, Mickey Mouse!

当你把垃圾《花木兰》兜售给中国的时候
You made the deal with the devil

※2020年上映的迪士尼动画改编真人电影 口碑不佳

你就和魔鬼做了交易！
When you sold your "Mulan" shit to China!

然后你把我也拉上了 向我吹嘘中国有多好
And then you took me out and sold me on how great China was

以及该怎样跪舔他们！
And how we should all suck their dick!

你让我丢失了节操 和一切我曾经拥有的特别之物…
You made me lose my tegridy and anything special that I had --

特别 等一下
Special. Wait a minute

就是它了
That's it

是什么？哈哈
What's it? Ha ha

特别之物 疫情特售！
The special. The Pandemic Special!

这样我就能把我的DNA注入别人体内了！
That's how we can get my DNA into people!

我们甚至可以神不知鬼不觉地为他们接种疫苗！
We can vaccinate them without them even knowing!

你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

在你杀我之前先给我几天时间吧
Just give me a couple more days before you have me killed

我 我觉得我找到了解决办法
I-I think I know a way out of this


兰迪？
Randy?

嘘！嘿 金博
Shh! Hey, Jimbo

你 你在干什么…？
W-What are you...?

放松 金博 我想我可能找到治疗新冠肺炎的方法了
It's okay, Jimbo. I think I might have a cure for COVID

你只需要相信我 好吗？
You're just gonna have to trust me, okay?

呃
Unh

呃啊啊
Ohhhhhhh

嘘 嘘！
-Uh...Uh...-Shh!

马上就会好起来了  -不 呃…
This is gonna be great. -No, uh...

好了 好了 现在呼吸
It's okay. It's okay. Just breathe

呼 吸
Br-e-e-e-eathe

没问题的
- -It's okay

会好起来的 呼吸
It's okay. Breathe

※此歌为电影《极度空间》中的插曲《Coming to L.A.》

我们很想你 宝贝！
We miss ya, honey!

我们已经等不及隔离结束了！
We can't wait for quarantine to be over! Heh

四组！你们的用餐时间结束了！
Group 4! Your meal is over!

回到你们班里去！
Back to your class!

好的 五组 现在是用餐时间！
Alright. Group 5, it's now mealtime!

进来吧 但注意保持你们的社交距离！
Come in but keep your social distance!

很好 这种距离就挺好 非常好
Yeah, that's good social distancing. Real good

3月16号！那是3月16号！
March 16th! It was March 16th!

已经那么久了！
That's how long it's been!

本应该有场派对的！
It was supposed to be a party!

在造熊工坊举办一个盛大的 快乐的派对
A big, happy gathering at Build-A-Bear

庆祝我看牙医的时候像个大孩子一样勇敢
To celebrate me being a big boy at the dentist!

然后他们就把造熊工坊关了
Then they shut it all down

他们说我得等到四月份
They said I'd have to wait until April

然后说要等到五月 之后他们又说我得等到夏天！
And then it was May. And then they said wait until summer!

现在已经是他妈的十月了！
It's fucking October now!

为什么没有人告诉我真相？
Why doesn't anyone tell me the truth?

我再也去不了造熊工坊了！
That I'm never going to Build-A-Bear!

再也去不了了！
That I'm never going ever again!

巴特斯 巴特斯 你冷静点
Butters, Butters, you gotta calm down

我再也去不了造熊工坊了 是吧？
I'm never going to Build-A-Bear, am I?

哦 嘿 老师 抱歉 等 等一下 我错了
Oh, hey, Teachers. Sorry. W-Wait. I'm sorry

我不去造熊工坊了！伙计们？
I don't need to go to Build-A-Bear! Fellas?

兰迪 车钥匙在哪？
Randy. Where are the car keys?

兰迪！
Randy!

啊？ 哦…什么？你说什么？
Huh? Uh... What? What?

车钥匙在哪？
Where are the car keys?

可能在我的裤兜里 怎么了？
They're probably in my pants pocket. Why?

我得去医院
I have to get over to the hospital

医院？你去干什么？
The hospital? For what?

是金博 医生说他现在好多了 所以我能带他回家
It's Jimbo. Doctor said he's better, so I can take him home

-金博好多了？ -他们说他现在没有任何症状
- Jimbo's better? - They said he doesn't have

而且他的核酸检测呈阴性
Any symptoms, and his tests are showing negative

天啊
Holy shit

起作用了 它帮上忙了！
It works. It can help!

哦
Unh

哦 我的天
Oh, boy

凯尔 我得和你谈谈
Kyle, I need to talk to you

嘿 老兄 我真的很担心…
Hey, dude. I'm really worried..

很担心巴特斯的情况 我觉得他病了
About Butters. I think he's sick

你觉得他感染了病毒？
You think he got the virus?

不！是别的东西
No! It's all the other stuff

是孤立和猜疑
The isolation and the uncertainty

我真的很担心新冠肺炎带来的一些东西
I'm just really worried what all the stuff

会对一些孩子造成影响
Around COVID is doing to some kids

你也知道 不是所有的小孩都像我们一样
You know, not every kid is like us

有些孩子真的没办法再忍受了
There's some kids who really can't take it anymore

我知道 这烂透了
I know. This bullshit sucks

但巴特斯会没事的
But Butters'll be okay

如果他并非如此呢？
And what if he's not?

如果巴特斯真的开始神志不清了呢？
What if Butters is actually starting to lose his mind?

如果他真的觉得自己的身体歇逼了呢？
What if he feels his body shutting down right now?

你真的认为那么糟了吗？
You really think it's that bad?

我们是时候向比学校里的警察们
It's time for us to ask for help

更富有权威的人
From someone who has more authority

求助的时候了
At this school than these cops

总统先生！疾控中心打来电话
Mr. President! The CDC is on the line

他们必须马上和你谈谈！
They need to speak with you urgently!

让他们去舔我的屁眼
Tell them to suck my asshole

总统先生  福奇博士在二号电话线
Mr. President, Dr. Fauci is on line two

食品药品监督管理局局长在三号电话线
And FDA chief is on line three

哦！让福奇去捅他自己的屁眼
Ooh! Tell Fauci to shove it up his ass

然后让食药监局局长明白他得舔光我的蛋
And let the FDA chief know he can eat shit off my balls

阁下！阁下 四号线有一通
Sir! Sir, you have an urgent call on line four

来自奴隶先生的紧急呼电
From a Mr. Slave

奴隶先生？
Mr. Slave?

好吧 快接！接接接！
Okay, go! Go, go, go!

喂？我是美国总统
Yes? This is the President of the entire United States

你好 我是斯坦·马什
Uh, hi. It's Stan Marsh

斯坦·马什？奴隶先生在哪？
Stan Marsh? Where's Mr. Slave?

我很抱歉 我们不得不引起你注意
I'm sorry. We had to get your attention

听着 我们现在被困在学校
Listen, we're being kept at the school

这里有个学生病得很重
And one of the students here is really sick

老天爷啊 又来了
Oh, for Pete's sake, here we go again

你该做啥做啥 我很忙的
Just deal with it. I am busy

不 不行 总统先生 求你了！
No, no, Mr. President, please!

你得回南方公园来
You gotta come back to South Park

我们的老师们在朝人们开枪！
Our teachers are shooting people!

每个人都在争吵 并且这里…在小镇外面
Everyone's arguing, and... and there's a facility

有个搜寻穿山甲和研制疫苗的机构
Outside of town that found the pangolin and are working on a vaccine

你也许能阻止疫情蔓延！
You might be able to stop the pandemic!

为什么我要这么做？
Why would I do that?

哈？
Huh?

斯坦 对于一个孩子来说
Stan, this is gonna be very difficult

这很难理解
For a child to understand

但是我向美国公民做过承诺…
But I made a promise to the American people..

要干掉所有的墨西哥人
To get rid of all the Mexicans

但传染病不只会杀死墨西哥人
But the pandemic isn't just killing Mexicans

它会杀掉他们中的很多人
It's killing a lot of them

我仔细检查过数据 斯坦
I've gone over the statistics, Stan

我现在要做的就是把雪崩引向正确的方向
All I have to do now is sort of guide the avalanche in right direction

并且我正在履行对美国公民的承诺
And I'm fulfilling my promises to the American People

直到传染病发生之前 我都收拾烂摊子
I was doing a crap job until this pandemic happened

你就打算坐在那里什么都不做？
You're just going to sit there and not do anything?

我打算积极不采取任何措施
I am going to actively not do anything

你就去舔我的蛋然后去死吧
And you can eat shit off my balls and die

真该死！
God dammit!

来 给你
Okay, there you go

我现在只能卖给你这些了
That's all I can sell you right now

你一定得吸它 知道吗？
Just make sure you smoke it, okay?

尽情享受特售吧
Enjoy the special

等 等一下 各位！
H-Hang on, guys!

我得再准备些 只需要给我四分钟左右就好
I gotta prep some more. Just give me like four minutes

兰迪？
Randy?

噢！兰迪！
Oh! Randy!

怎…怎么了？
Just... what?

兰迪 你赶紧过来！
Randy, you've gotta get in here!

我正在做重要的事 莎伦！
I'm doing something important, Sharon!

人们现在就需要这个！
People need this right now!

快上楼 金博有些不对劲！
Come upstairs. Something's wrong with Jimbo!

他睡了好几天了
He's just been sleeping for days

医生说他正在好转
They said he was getting better

昨天晚上他又发烧了
Last night, his fever came back

然后几小时前他的脸上长了这些东西
And then a few hours ago, this thing appeared on his face

什么东西？
What thing?

金博根本长不出一字胡
Jimbo's never been able to grow a mustache

哈 这可奇了怪了
Huh. That's weird

我应该把医生找来吗？
Should I call the doctor?

不！不 不 不要！不要找医生！
No! No, no, no! Don't call the doctor!

他们正忙着呢 这是前所未有的情况
They're busy. These are unprecedented times

我 我们不知道这是由什么导致的
W-We have no idea what caused this

特售…
Special..

什么事 金博？
What, Jimbo?

疫情…呃…特售…
Pandemic... uh... Special..

为什么他要提你的特售？
Why's he talking about your special?

每个人都在谈论特售 莎伦
Everyone's talking about the special, Sharon

这很重要 很明显他现在需要这个
It's a big deal. He obviously needs it right now

我去拿温度计
I'm gonna get the thermometer

快他妈把嘴闭上！
Just fucking shut up!

你又不知道是不是因为特售！
You have no idea if it's because of the special!

你很可能会再次染病
You could just be sick again

因为你他妈就是个嗜酒如命的死肥子
'Cause you're a fat fucking alcoholic

我才不要因为你进监狱！
And I am not going to jail for you!

你说你之前从没长过一字胡？
And you say you've never had a mustache before?

没！从来没有过！
No! Never!

它突然就凭空长出来了！
It just came outta nowhere!

怎么会发生这种事 医生？
How can this happen, doctor?

最近你有摄取任何有毒物质进入体内吗？
Have you put anything toxic in your body lately?

任何毒品或者酒精？
Any drugs or alcohol?

没有！我的意思是…
No! I mean..

我只是尝了一点点疫情特售…
I've enjoyed a little of the Pandemic Special..

噢 不不不 那没有任何问题
Oh, no, no no. That... That's totally fine

医生！
Doctor!

你最好赶紧来趟急诊室！
You better come to the emergency room!

我的天啊
Holy shit

究竟是出现了另一种新冠病毒
Another strain of COVID

还是只是新的和新冠有关的症状？
Or simply more COVID-related symptoms?

据报道 帕克县有十分之一的人长出了一字胡
A reported one in 10 people in Park County

并且似乎没人知道这是为什么
Are experiencing mustaches and nobody seems to know why

市长向传染病专家寻求了帮助
The mayor has called for help from infectious disease experts

安东尼·福奇博士今日抵达南方公园医院
And Dr. Anthony Fauci arrived

※美国顶级传染病专家 应对新冠病毒特别小组成员之一

并给出了他的专业意见
At South Park Hospital today to give his advice

我们并不清楚为什么有些人长出了一字胡而有些人没有
We aren't sure why some people are getting a mustache

但我们必须要竭尽所能
And some aren't, but we have to do all we can

来防止其大规模流行
To avoid it becoming fashionable

我们的下巴尿布能保障我们的安全吗？
Will our chin diapers keep us safe?

可以 但我们必须把它们戴在会长出一字胡的地方
Yes, but we must wear them where the mustache would be

我们需要用它们遮住我们的口鼻
We need to wear them over our mouth and nose

你脑子出问题了吧？
Are you out of your mind?

你想让人们在鼻子上穿尿布？
You expect people to wear a diaper over their nose?

那可真恶心 去你妈的吧 福奇！
That's disgusting. Fuck you, Fauci!

市民们被要求待在家中
Citizens are asked to stay indoors

并试着放松身心
And just try and relax

而且也许可以享受更多疫情特售大麻
And maybe enjoy some of the Pandemic Special

不要！操！
No! Shit!

爽
Nice

巴特斯…？巴特斯？
Butters...? Butters?

-什么？ -别担心
Wha? Don't worry

我会救你的！
I'm going to save you!

好 把我从什么救出来中？
Okay. Save me from what?

大伙！大伙！
Guys! Guys!

什么？谁呀？
What? Who is it?

大家 我们必须把巴特斯从这里救出去
You guys, we have to get Butters out of here

我们还能联系到谁呢 斯坦？
Who else can we call, Stan?

不是 我们必须把他从这里救出去 就现在
No. We have to get him out of here, now

我们需要带他去造熊工坊
We need to take him to Build-A-Bear

你疯了吧？
Are you nuts?

他需要出去做些正常的事！
He has to go out and do something normal!

斯坦 现在造熊工坊只有靠预约才能进去
Stan, Build-A-Bear is currently by appointment only

并且一次最多只能容纳四个人
And a only maximum party of four can visit at one time

我们不能干坐着
We can't sit around and wait for people

等着别人来搞清楚状况 知道吗？
To figure things out, okay?

这是不可能发生的
It's not gonna happen

他们只会继续剥夺他的一切
They just keep taking everything from him

然后说这是为了他好
And saying it's for his own good

但谁说他不能出去 然后他妈享受一点点乐趣呢？
But who's to say he can't go out and have a little goddamn fun?

如果我们想要让一切回归正常
If we want things to go back to normal

那么我们就必须得做点什么！
Then we just gotta go do it!

斯坦说得对
Stan's right. If we want things

如果我们想让一切回归正常 我们必须得靠自己
To go back to normal, we have to do it ourselves

他们只会设置更多限制
They're just gonna keep making more restrictions

以及更多的规则
And more rules, and who's gonna fight

所以谁愿意来为一切回归原样而做出争斗？
To go back to the way things were?

我肯定加入！
I sure as hell will!

我们能为了巴特斯让一切事变得再次正常起来
We can make things normal for Butters again

以及照常上课！
And make school the way it was

照常上课！在我们自己的房间里上网课！
The way it was! Online, in our own rooms!

等等 什么？
Wait. What?

不 我是说在教室里 和真正的老师一起！
No, in a class, with real teachers!

等一下 你在说什么？你说的照常是指什么？
Wait. What? What normal are you talking about?

我说的照常是指 回到像三月份那样的状态
I'm talking about normal, like back in March

你说的照常又是指什么？
What normal are you talking about?

我说的是像三天前那样
I'm talking about normal like three days ago

那时一切都棒极了
When everything was awesome

听着 这不重要
Look, it doesn't matter

我们他妈只需要离开这里
We just gotta break the fuck outta here

提米！
Timmy!

新一轮疫情在南方公园迅速扩散
The new outbreak in South Park is spreading rapidly

由于通往城镇的高速公路关闭
And as highways into town close

政府在考虑进行全面封锁
And governments consider a full lockdown

大家都在想同一个问题
One question is on everyone's mind

那只该死的穿山甲到底在哪？
Where is the damn pangolin?

一些人猜测穿山甲已经自寻死路了
Some speculate the pangolin took its own life

而另一些人认为…稍等
While others think tha... Sorry

抱歉 我们现在接到最新消息！
Sorry, we're getting some breaking news!

哦 天呐
Oh, God

南方公园小学的学生们
Students at South Park Elementary School

逃出了隔离区 正在外面游荡！
Have broken quarantine and are now out on the loose!

这些小孩是昨晚某个时候跑掉的
The fugitives broke out sometime last night

老师们反映 现在没有理由高度警惕
Teachers are reporting there's no cause for alarm

只是这些孩子们都暴露了在满是新冠的环境中
Except that these children have all been exposed to COVID

他们四处流窜并传播着一字胡病毒
And could Be running around spreading mustaches right now!

超级传播者！
Super spreaders!

一家只能买一罐剃须膏！
One can of shaving cream per family!

巴特斯？
Butters?

巴特斯 你赶紧回到隔离区
Butters, you get back to quarantine

要不然你就要被禁足了！
Or you are gonna be grounded!

嘿 斯多奇！
Hey, Stotch!

你听到科学家说什么了吗！

Thanks for getting my hopes up, you asshole!

走吧 伙计 我们最好在被发现前离开这里
Come on, dude, we better get outta here before we're spotted

-我们不能走 -你什么意思？
-We can't go. -What do you mean?

我们没有选择 我们必须要闯进去
We don't have a choice. We're gonna have to break in

接着干什么？
And then do what?

接着给他造一只小熊！
And then build him a bear!

在没有任何工作人员协助的情况下？
Without any employees?

什么 你觉得我们能…造一只自己的小熊？
What, do you expect us to just...build our own bear?

如果我们不得不这么做 就是这样
If we have to, yes

伙计  你需要让工作人员帮你填充和封缝
Dude, you need people to help you do the stuffing and the closing

你…你实际根本不知道怎么去造一只自己的小熊-
You don't...You don't actually build your own bear--

我不管！我不会再听这些规矩了
I don't care! I'm not following the rules anymore

你他妈在干什么？

I just gotta take all the Pandemic Special

载到汤普森湖然后扔了它们
Over to Thompson Lake and dump it

扔了？
Dump it?

你现在为什么要担心这个？
Why are you worrying about this right now?

因为疫情特售需要结束了
Because the Pandemic Special needs to end

特售必须要结束 莎伦
A special has to end, Sharon

否则它就不能被称作“特售”了 对吧？
Or else it's not really a "special," is it?

妈的 兰迪 我们的儿子还处在这场混乱中呢！
God dammit, Randy, our son is out in this chaos!

现在不是让你去处理
This is not the time for you to be dealing with

你那些狗屁大麻的时候！
Your fucking marijuana!

必须要有人找到他！
Somebody's gotta find him!

不 不！好！好 好 等一下 我来了！
No, no! Okay! Okay, okay, hold on, I'm coming!

也许我们可以在路上阻止这场特售
Maybe we can just stop the special by the lake on the way

操你妈的！
Fuck you!

我们到了 巴特斯！看啊 你做到了！
Here we are, Butters! Look...you made it!

哦 伙计们！这是梦吗？
Oh, boy! Is this a dream?

不 这不是梦！
No, it's not a dream!

我们真的在这里 而且我们即将要给你造一只熊！
We are really here, and we are gonna build you a bear!

St-a-a-a-a-an!

兰迪 要是斯坦死了怎么办？
What if he's dead, Randy?

他没死 莎伦
He's not dead, Sharon

那他为什么还没给我们打过电话？
Then why hasn't he even called?

嘿 能卖我点疫情特售吗？
Hey, can we have some of that Pandemic Special?

不能！
No!

现在大家不需要特售了
Nobody needs the special right now!

它根本不管用！
It's not helping!

噢 我的天
Oh, my God

-噢 天呐 不  -又怎么了？
Oh, God, no. What?

苹果蜂餐厅也被封了
They got Applebee's, too

回农场吧 莎伦
Drive me back to the farm, Sharon

我要拿个东西
I need to get something

见鬼了！
God dammit!

伙计 还是别管了
Dude, just let it go

不行 凯尔 我们不能让巴特斯失望！
No, Kyle, we can't let Butters down!

斯坦 你确定你这么做是为了巴特斯吗？
Stan, are you sure this is about Butters?

因为你似乎拼了命想造一只小熊
'Cause you seem really desperate to build a bear

那些抗议打砸的人听好了！
Attention protesting looters!

抗议和劫持违反了
Protesting slash looting is a violation

市长的卫生治安令
Of the mayor's health order

你们有五分钟的时间从里面出来
You have five minutes to come out

否则我们就要采取行动了
Or we will have to take action

我们得投降 伙伴们！
We gotta surrender, fellas!

而且我在造熊工坊这也没那么开心 讲真
I'm honestly not having that much fun anyways

不！我才不投降！
No! I'm not giving up!

好了 五分钟差不多到了
All right, that was about five minutes

兄弟们 家伙准备好！
Okay, boys, light 'em up!

等一下！
Wait!

所有人 都停下！
Everyone just stop!

这特么是谁啊？
Who the hell is that?

我有可能改变这一切的东西
I have something that might change all of this

是那只穿山甲！ 快看！
It's the pangolin! Look!

穿山甲！ 他找到了！
He found it! The pangolin!

他找到那只穿山甲了！
He's found it!

这是你们在找的东西 是吗？
This is what you've all been looking for, right?

行了
Well, here!

拿去做你们打算做的实验吧
Go ahead and do all the tests you want on it

你们会知道
You'll find out...

该知道的一切
Everything you need to know

见鬼 不行！ 我不会就这样让你们结束疫情的！
Oh, no! You're not ending this pandemic!

喂 卡特曼 别！
Hey! Cartman, no!

别杀了它 卡特曼！ 那东西是我们唯一的希望了
Don't do it, Cartman! That thing is our only chance

那是你们唯一的希望！为了你们的正常生活 不是我的！
Your only chance! For your normal, not mine!

我才不要上学！
I am not going back to school!

好吧 你们说对了
You guys were right, okay?

我这样做不是为了巴特斯
This hasn't been about Butters

只是因为我自己受不了
I've been acting like this because I can't take

这些停工停学的事情了
These shutdowns anymore

我害怕疫情对我造成的影响
And I'm scared what it's doing to me

所以我想找人怪罪
I'm looking for who to blame

说着想帮助别人
Saying I'm trying to help people

让自己好受一些 但说实话…
To make myself feel better, because the truth is...

我只是想过回以前的生活
I just want to have fun again

我想让我能走出家门 面向世界
I wanted to see that I could go out in the world

做我以前做的事 但我做不到
And do things that I used to do, but I can't

我没变得更好
I'm not any better

也不比其他人更在乎这一切
And I don't care any more than anyone else

我这么做只是想过回我以前的生活而已
And I did all this because I just want my life back

我只想过回以前的生活…
I just want my life back...

我真不敢相信…
I don't believe it

那…那现在怎么样了？
So...So what happens now?

现在我们有希望了
Now we have hope

我们认识到 虽然我们也许没法过回从前的生活
We've learned that we might never get back to our old lives

但是只要齐心协力 我们就能找到新的方式适应…
But by working together, we just might find a new way to...

噶啊啊！ 噢噢噢！
Aargh! Ohh!

别忘了出门投票啊 大伙们
Don't forget to get out and vote, everybody!

总统大选就要来喽
Big election coming up

由于南方公园小学的学生们突破了隔离
And since the students broke quarantine

※背景指2020年9月美国西部发生大规模山火

现在所有南方公园居民都暴露在疫情风险中
All South Park residents are now exposed

该镇将被完全封锁 未来将走向何方仍不得而知
And under complete lockdown for the unforeseeable future

我该怎么开始道歉呢？
How do I even begin to apologize?

你们说的对
You guys we were right

我想 我的脑子确实是被大麻搞糊涂了
I think all the marijuana really did go to my head

你们说…毒品就是毒品 我也不是从前的我了
You said it, a drug is a drug, and I'm not who I used to be

我是时候该坦白一切了
It's time for me to own up to everything

大家也是时候知道是什么引发了这场疫情
It's time everyone knew what started this pandemic

嘿 莎伦 我有事要和你谈谈
Hey, Sharon, I need to talk to you

我没你那么坚强 莎伦
I'm not as strong as you are, Sharon

我没法像你一样面对艰难时世
I can't deal with hard times the way that you can

只要你想谈 我随时都会听的 兰迪
If you're ready to talk, I'm ready to listen, Randy

怎么了？
What?

你说你不想和疫情特售扯上关系
You want nothing to do with the Pandemic Special

我说过 兰迪 我不吸大麻
No. I don't smoke marijuana, Randy

嗯哼
Uh-huh

你要和我谈什么吗？
What did you want to talk to me about?

我觉得 我会继续搞特售活动的
I just...think maybe I'm gonna do a few more specials

哦对了 你脸上沾了些脏东西
You got some shit on your face
